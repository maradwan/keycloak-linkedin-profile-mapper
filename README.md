# Keycloak LinkedIn SPI Enricher

This Keycloak Service Provider Interface (SPI) extension enriches user information retrieved from LinkedIn by fetching additional fields such as:

- `vanityName`
- `headline` (LinkedIn title)
- High-resolution `profilePicture` URLs

This is useful when using **LinkedIn as an Identity Provider** (IdP) in Keycloak and you need more than just the default `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.

---

## Features

Fetches and stores:

- `vanityName` as a custom user attribute  
- `headline` as a custom user attribute  
- `profilePicture` in multiple resolutions as custom user attributes

Automatically works on **first login** and **user sync**

Fully compatible with Keycloak 22â€“26+
